MacGifer, Dropbox gif manager
=============================

MacGifer helps you getting the right reaction gif at the right time. You simply
add gifs to your collection and set tags on them:

    macgifer add https://media.giphy.com/media/dbtDDSvWErdf2/giphy.gif itcrowd fire

And when the need comes, get the URL to your saved gif copied to your clipboard:

    macgifer get fire

If multiple gifs match your tag(s), one will be picked randomly. You can of
course search for multiple tags:

    macgifer get fire itcrowd
